Prior to building the RPM, check if the autoconf version on the machine is >= 2.60 using:

autoconf --version

If not, install autoconf 2.60 from the tools directory on this repo:

./configure
make
[sudo] make install

To build the RPM, run build-rpm.sh (with necessary revision changes in the first few lines):

./build-rpm.sh

The RPM will be created at <current_dir>/membase-build/RPMS/x86_64/
